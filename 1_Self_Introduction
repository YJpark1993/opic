Hello, Eva. Nice you meet you.
I'm glad to have an opportunity to tell you about my self.
I'm Yujin Park but you can just call me Jin.
I was born in 1993, which puts me in my late 20's

I'm not married but I have a girlfriend.
So when I get off my work I hang out with my girlfriend go fancy restaurant and
go cafe and drink coffee and so on.
I live alone and also Because Last year I got a job so I moved to Seoul.

I like to play soccer with my friend from university. we usally get together on weekend
Maybe that is one of the way how I get rid of my working stress.

I enjoyed telling you about myself. Thank you for listening. Eva.
